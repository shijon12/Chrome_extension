# Chrome_extension
In this project, I have created a chrome extension using javascript where I will be able to track the tabs I want. This is particularly useful for sales people and/or business analysts who wants to keep track of their users. The code is documented with proper syntaxes and the comments are self explanatory. Hope anyone who comes across this finds this helpful
